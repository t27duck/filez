# Hosting the app yourself

* Fork the repo.
* Create a "production" branch.
  * This allows you to sync `main` with upstream
  * Merge `main` with changes in your other branch.
* Generate a `lockbox` key and set it up in app credentials or an environment variable.
  See: https://github.com/ankane/lockbox?tab=readme-ov-file#key-generation
* Deploy and enjoy.

# First-time use

The first time you visit the app, you will be prompted for a password.
